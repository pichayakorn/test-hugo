1. Download LM Studio from [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).
2. Download large language models from the "Search" page:  
   To ensure fairness to the fullï¼Œthese **open-source models** are recommended to be used:

   - `qwen2.5-32B`: `Q8_0` [bartowski/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-GGUF](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/bartowski/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-GGUF)
   - `phi-3-medium`: `Q8_0` [ssmits/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q8_0-GGUF](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/ssmits/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct-Q8_0-GGUF)
   - `llama3.1-70B`: `Q4_K_M` [bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-GGUF](https://model.lmstudio.ai/download/bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-GGUF)

   _If your computer can't afford these models, you are welcome to use other open-source models. Finally we will evaluate the submitted prompts by these three models._

3. Once the model is downloaded, navigate to the "Local Server" tab, select the model, and click "Start Server".  
   Please view more details on [Prompt Engineering for Science Birds Level Generation and Beyond](https://chatgpt4pcg.github.io/tutorial)
4. You can start the tutorial code from [this github repository](https://github.com/chatgpt4pcg/tutorial-2024-notebook)
5. We provide a few example programs implemented using various prompt engineering techniques. These examples are offered to assist you in getting started with the competition. You can utilize these examples as a foundation to develop your own advanced prompt engineering techniques. The examples are accessible in a GitHub repository, which you can find [here](https://github.com/chatgpt4pcg/pe-examples?tab=readme-ov-file)
   _(openai'key is needed to run the code for previous [ChatGPT4PCG 2 competition](https://chatgpt4pcg.github.io/))_
