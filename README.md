# The LLMs4PCG Competition: Character-like Level Generation for Science Birds

The LLMs4PCG Competition builds upon the challenging and exciting spirit of the first and second ChatGPT4PCG competitions while introducing significant changes. This edition expands the competition beyond ChatGPT to include a variety of open-source large language models (LLMs). Participants are challenged to develop prompts or prompt engineering techniques that can construct stable Science Birds levels resembling uppercase English characters using these diverse LLMs.

We've enhanced the competition platform to support a wide range of open-source LLMs, allowing participants to explore and compare the capabilities of different models. Submissions can now be in the form of Python programs, enabling more complex prompt engineering techniques that utilize conditions, iterations, and advanced logic. This opens up possibilities for developing novel approaches and potentially creating new prompt engineering methods tailored to specific LLMs.

The competition welcomes participants of all skill levels, from those who simply modify existing prompts to those who develop sophisticated prompt engineering techniques. All submitted programs will be evaluated for qualification according to the competition rules and used to generate levels for each target English uppercase character across multiple LLMs. The generated levels will be assessed for stability using our Science Birds Evaluator and checked for similarity to target characters using an upgraded Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier. We retain the diversity metric introduced in ChatGPT4PCG 2, challenging participants to create prompts that generate stable, similar, and diverse levels across different open-source LLMs. This multi-model approach provides a unique opportunity to explore the strengths and limitations of various LLMs in the context of procedural content generation.
